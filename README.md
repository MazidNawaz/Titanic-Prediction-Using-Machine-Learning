# Titanic-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Description:
Worked on the classic Titanic dataset to build predictive models that determine the survival of passengers. Applied key machine learning techniques including data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Achieved strong accuracy and improved model performance using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
## Outcome:
Successfully submitted the project on Kaggle and ranked among the top percentile in the leaderboard for beginner-level competitions.
